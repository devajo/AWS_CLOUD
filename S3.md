# Hosting a static website on S3 bucket

## Introduction
AWS S3 is great place to host a static website.If you want the DNS domain of your choice then use [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) service.I will discuss about Amazon Route 53 in another tutorial.In this tutorial my personal website page is going to have DNS domain name in the the following format.<br>
NAME_OF_THE_WEBSITE.s3.AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/index.html


## Best Practice
It is a efficient practice to create AWS resources using AWS CLI(Commmand Line Interface).You will need to install AWs CLI on your local computer.The administrator of the account should create a new user with the necessary permission and provide the user with <b>Access key Id,Secret Access key</b>.<br>
Maintaining you source code in version control repository is great when you are working in a team and also useful track your changes and history.

## Intial Setup
To make sure that AWS CLI is installed on the local machine enter the following command on Command prompt `aws --version`.Please note my local computer operating system is Windows 10.The commands could differ for Mac or Linux.
